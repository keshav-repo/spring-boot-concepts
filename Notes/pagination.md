## Pagination 

Pagination in RESTful API calls is a technique used to manage and retrieve large sets of data in smaller, manageable chunks called pages. When a client makes a request to an API endpoint that can potentially return a large number of results, the API server breaks down the response into multiple pages to avoid overwhelming the client with all the data at once.

The main purpose of pagination is to improve the efficiency of data retrieval and reduce the response time by only returning a subset of the total data, based on the client's request.

Pagination is commonly implemented using query parameters in the URL of the API request. The most common pagination parameters are:

1. **page**: Indicates the page number to retrieve. For example, `page=1` would retrieve the first page, `page=2` would retrieve the second page, and so on.

2. **per_page** (or limit): Specifies the number of items to include in each page. For example, `per_page=10` would indicate that each page should contain 10 items.

When a client makes an API request with pagination parameters, the server processes the request and returns the appropriate page of data along with metadata indicating the total number of items available and the number of pages.

Here's an example of a RESTful API endpoint that supports pagination:

```
GET /api/v1/users?page=2&per_page=10
```

In this example, the client is requesting the second page of user data, with 10 users per page.

The API response might look like this:

```json
{
  "page": 2,
  "per_page": 10,
  "total_items": 35,
  "total_pages": 4,
  "data": [
    // List of 10 user objects
  ]
}
```

In this response, the `data` field contains the list of 10 users on the requested page, while the `total_items` and `total_pages` fields provide information about the total number of users and the total number of pages available, respectively.

By using pagination, clients can request and process data in a more manageable manner, and API servers can handle large datasets efficiently without overloading resources.
