### DispatcherServlet

In Spring Boot, the `DispatcherServlet` is a core component that handles incoming HTTP requests and dispatches them to the appropriate handlers (controllers) for processing. It acts as the front controller in the Spring MVC framework.

The `DispatcherServlet` is automatically configured in a Spring Boot application when you use the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation, which includes the `@EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation. This enables the auto-configuration of the `DispatcherServlet` based on the application's classpath and dependencies.

The `DispatcherServlet` is responsible for several key tasks:

1. Request Mapping: It maps incoming requests to specific controller methods based on the defined URL patterns and HTTP methods.

2. Request Processing: It processes the incoming request, including parsing request parameters, headers, and content.

3. Handler Execution: It invokes the appropriate controller method to handle the request, passing along the necessary request parameters.

4. View Resolution: After the controller method has processed the request, the `DispatcherServlet` resolves the view that should be rendered as the response. It typically uses a view resolver to map logical view names to the actual view templates.

5. Response Handling: The `DispatcherServlet` sets the response status, headers, and content based on the controller's response and the configured view.

The `DispatcherServlet` plays a crucial role in the request handling process in Spring Boot applications. It provides a centralized entry point for all incoming requests and orchestrates the execution flow by delegating the request handling to the appropriate controllers.

You can also customize the behavior of the `DispatcherServlet` by configuring it in your application's `web.xml` or by extending the `WebMvcConfigurerAdapter` class and overriding its methods. However, in most cases, Spring Boot's auto-configuration provides sensible defaults, and you may not need to explicitly configure the `DispatcherServlet` unless you have specific requirements.

### What is servlet ? 
A servlet is a Java programming language class that is used to extend the capabilities of a server. It is a server-side component that receives requests and generates responses based on those requests. Servlets are part of the Java Servlet API, which provides a standard way to interact with web-based applications using the HTTP protocol.

Servlets run on a web server and handle requests from clients, such as web browsers or mobile applications. They are typically used to implement dynamic web applications, where the content of a web page is generated on the fly based on user input or other data sources.

Servlets follow a lifecycle model, which includes the following stages:

1. Initialization: The servlet is loaded into memory and initialized. This stage allows the servlet to perform any necessary setup tasks, such as connecting to a database or loading configuration files.

2. Request Handling: The servlet listens for incoming requests from clients. When a request is received, the servlet's `service()` method is invoked to process the request. The `service()` method typically delegates the request to other methods, such as `doGet()` or `doPost()`, based on the HTTP method of the request.

3. Response Generation: After processing the request, the servlet generates a response to send back to the client. This can include HTML content, JSON data, or any other type of response based on the application's logic.

4. Destruction: When the web server is shut down or the servlet is no longer needed, the servlet's `destroy()` method is called. This allows the servlet to release any resources it has acquired during its lifetime.

Servlets provide a powerful and flexible way to handle web requests and build web applications in Java. They are widely used in Java web frameworks, such as JavaServer Faces (JSF), JavaServer Pages (JSP), and Spring MVC, to handle the request-response cycle and process user interactions.
