### assertEquals
In this example, the assertEquals method is used to compare the expectedObject and actualObject for equality. JUnit internally calls the equals method of the objects to perform the comparison.
```java
public static void assertEquals(Object expected, Object actual)
```

## assertSame
In this example, the assertSame method is used to compare the references of expectedObject and actualObject to check if they point to the same instance.
