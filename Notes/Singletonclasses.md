## If Order service is a singleton class in spring boot application, how this class will handle multiple request
If the Order service class in a Spring Boot application is implemented as a singleton, it will handle multiple requests using concurrency mechanisms provided by the underlying framework.

**Spring Boot applications typically run within a web server container that manages the handling of incoming HTTP requests. When multiple requests are received simultaneously, the web server spawns multiple threads to handle those requests concurrently**.

**In the case of a singleton service class like the Order service, Spring Boot will ensure that each request is processed by a separate thread, allowing multiple requests to be handled concurrently. As a singleton, the Order service instance will be shared among all the threads, ensuring that the state is shared across requests.**

It's important to ensure that the Order service class is designed to be thread-safe, meaning that concurrent access to its shared state is properly synchronized or managed using other concurrency mechanisms. This ensures that multiple threads can safely access and modify the shared state of the Order service without causing data inconsistencies or race conditions.

By default, Spring Boot manages the concurrency and thread-safety aspects of singleton services, allowing them to handle multiple requests concurrently. However, it's essential to consider and test the thread-safety of the service implementation and handle any potential concurrency issues, such as race conditions or data inconsistencies, to ensure the correctness and reliability of the application.
